# Advanced-Snake-Game

A game made in html using Canvas.
This code was initially based on [another code](https://gist.github.com/straker/ff00b4b49669ad3dec890306d348adc4),
I would like to thank [Steven Lambert](https://gist.github.com/straker) therefore.


This version has the following improvements:
<p>

- The snake doesn't die when colliding with itself<p>
- Now snake adjusts itself to grid, block and canvas size. It spawns on the other side regardless of canvas or block size<p>
- There is another apple that spawns, if the snake eats it, it shrinks in size<p>
- Mobile controls <p>
- The snake is colored(the head has a unique color)<p>
- The snake spawns at a random location and in a random direction<p>
- Point count<p>
- Better organization of codes and variables <p>
